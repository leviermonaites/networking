## PURPOSE OF THIS REPOSITORY
Here, you are going to find some projects I made to have some practical experience on networking.<br>
If you have some networking knowledge or you are studying about the subject, it may be fun to see some experiments (it is not meant to be educational, though).

## Prerequisites to run the projects.
- You need to have the Cisco Packet Tracer software to open the .pkt extensions. (I my self downloaded it from [here](https://github.com/marcelobaptista/packettracer) [I use Arch Linux])
