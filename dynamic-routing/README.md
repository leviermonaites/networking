BULLET POINTS:
- Protocol used: RIP
- Each LAN has a DHCP Server configured (on its respective router)
- There is only one router sending update messages with a default-route configured
- There is no authentication on receiving and sending the RIP messages because of lack of compatibility between the routers in this software and RIP's authentication
