Bullet points:
- Router from 172.16.0.0 has a static route configured to communicate with the client from 192.168.0.0 (the next hop is the router from 192.168.0.0)
- Router from 192.168.0.0 has a static route configured to communicate with the client from 172.16.0.0 (the next hop is the router from 172.16.0.0)

These bullet points make it possible for one client ping the other.
